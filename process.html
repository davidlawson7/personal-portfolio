				<!-- Initial Brainstorming -->
				<h2>Initial Brainstorming</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Coming into this class we were tasked with braining storming and exploring a playful open ended concept for a physically interactive installation. This installation would be able to be applied to the research fields of either heathy aging, learning in early years, internet of things for people or big data. We were given a week and then asked to present our rough concept to the class.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I came up with a concept I called Storytime. It was an interactive holographic storytelling device targeted at kids aged between 6 to 10 years. I took inspiration from Star Treks Holodeck along with a recent invention called Holus. Storytime would project the story inside a small glass pyramid via the Peppers Ghost illusion. Cameras on each side of the pyramid would detect players and their inputs.</p>
				<br>
				<p>To me this concept was interesting as I knew stories as something we all love regardless of age. But at a young age, they are incredible useful tools for teaching morals, society norms and problem solving as well as general tools for passing on knowledge. They are successful at doing this due to the fact they engage and entertain the viewer, grabbing their attention and thus making them more receptive to new information.</p>

					<!-- Concept Creation -->
					<h2>Concept Creation</h2>
					<br>
					<p>From this point the class as a whole were tasked with refining the class concepts as a collective via a process called the World Cafe. We then chose our favourite topics and broke up into groups around them. I ended up being paired up with Simon Drummond, Jarrod Stone and Maximus Lee on my topic, Storytime. Everyone on the team really liked my concept and we then decided to head down the path of refining that into an installation. We wanted to have it present the player with a range of story options to choose from that would then be projected into the 3D space.</p>
					<br>
					<p>With some team brainstorming our initial concept was an interactive story experience that mimicked the classic “Goosebumps” and “Create Your Own Adventure” story books. In these books the reader would be presented with choices. These choices drove the story. Ultimately every read through has the potential to be a different experience with different endings. This method of storytelling was ultimately adapted for Space Rangers via a branching paths mechanism. Each path would trigger a new scene and a new set of tasks for characters to complete. The character when move on rails, experiencing the story and engaging in physical gesture challenges along the way.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Feedback from the class told us that we needed to both define our concept more and narrow it down to a single idea that involves some core physical interactions. We were focusing on projecting it in a 3D space, creating a range of interactive stories that used physical gestures and voices commands, a battle system with multiple players and a complex branching path system. All of this was too much to focus on and our idea was too broad. We decided to remove the battle system and limit the number of stories being made to just one.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-7">
					<!-- Project Proposal -->
					<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Using the feedback from the initial concept created we decided our game was going to be a magical fantasy game with two people. We called it “Quest for Thunder”. This was an adventure story which would follow a group of young wizards in search for their magical cat Thunder, who ran away. To find Thunder the players would need to overcome challanges like logic puzzle and riddles. The overall aim of the game was that its challanges would be educational for a younger audience, aged 6 to 10, but entertaining and engaging enough so that they wouldn't think of it as an educational game.</p>
					<br>
					<p>At this point players actions and choices would ultimately cause the game world to change and adapt, ultimately changing the story as they went along. Physical gestures include using a wand to cast spells at enemies and to create shields to protect you allies. You would also be able to move objects for physics puzzles and use voice commands to answer simple riddles. The more players worked together, the easier the game would be. This was to encourage team work. Unity was going to be used to create the game and Microsoft Kinect was going to be used to detect players and their gestures. The game world in Unity was to be project down in third person into a large glass prison using a 54inch TV the laboratory had (we thought this would help create some wow factor).</p>
					<br>
					<p>Feedback again at this stage told us that we needed to narrow our concepts scope down some more. We were focusing on to many high level concepts and story content without diving into the real interactions involved which the content needed to be modelled around. We once again went away and continued our work. Next up was the physical prototype.</p>

					<!-- Physical Prototyping -->
					<h2>Physical Prototyping</h2>
					<br>
					<p>We decided it would be useful to first test out some lo-fidelity prototypes mocking the of the physics puzzles we wanted to implement. The reason for this was that we figured it would help test the physical interactions while we were still struggling to narrow our concepts scope down.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We thought of two puzzles. A ball/pipe puzzle where players had to work together to raise and lower some pipes, moving a ball from one side of to the other. The second puzzle was a simple locked door puzzle. Players would need to rotate symbols on two separate pillars to create a pre-determined pattern to open the door. The aim of both of these puzzles was to promote team work and problem solving. We also built a prototype pyramid to test the peppers ghost illusion.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We did some basic user testing on family and friends and found that the ball puzzle was effective at promoting teamwork due to players having to co-ordinate their actions. The door puzzle was better at promoting problem solving skills and spatial reasoning. These prototypes were then presented to the class once again for another round off feedback. Feedback from the class suggested everyone was concerned we hadn't yet built a technical prototype. This wasn't too much of a concern as this was next on our agenda.</p>

					<!-- More Prototyping -->
					<h2>More Physical Prototyping</h2>
					<br>
					<p>We moved to our second round of physical prototyping which focused more on the interactions in a linear story context. We built the game world in Unity and started developing some basic puzzles using Kinect. At this stage the story was linear and the focus was on the user's physical gestures and voice commands. It was at this phase we hit some major issues. Firstly, we found that developing a system which gave useful user feedback was difficult. Not only to produce it but to do it in such a way that the player understand it. The second was content generation. This was probably the most time consuming aspect of the installation. As a result it delayed development and refinement of the installations physical interactions.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The story of the game was change at this point to a more Sci-Fi themed adventure with the hope it would suit our themes better. Simon called the story “Space Rangers” (which is clearly what we ran with). You crash landed on a mysterious planet. As Space Rangers you must fix your ship to get of the planet. This is done by talking to local inhabitants and completing challenges which would help them out. A single path was built into the game where you would explore some old castle ruins and find a locked away native. You would help him out by opening the door by pulling a lever via a pulling gesture. He would then give you an item which would repair your ship and you would be done.</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<p>It was here at this phase where we also decided to remove the Peppers Ghost Illusion from our installation. We did this because it wasn't adding anything to the interaction. We were also running out of time due to the massive amounts of content I needed to generate and script in Unity. Now the game was to either be projected onto a wall or presented on a TV. The Kinect and Mac Mini was to be displayed in a black cabinet underneath.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We were lucky enough to have Ben Mathews, a lecturer at the University of Queensland, bring his children into the lab so that we could complete some user testing with them (being our target audience and all). This is where we found that user feedback was a major problem with our installations physical installations. We also saw that it engaged the kids for a decent amount of time, considering the stories were quiet short (2 minutes). They wanted to play it over and over again, each time getting better at the physical gestures and challenges. This supported our original idea that interactive storytelling can help with learning in the early years.</p>

					<!-- The Edge -->
					<h2>The Edge</h2>
					<br>
					<p>After completing our second round of user testing we added branching paths into the game. We also attempted to make the interactions more responsive and place some physical feedback on screen to represent hand position (dark circles). We tested this out at the Edge. I built two endings into the game which would be accessible based on the choices they made. The feature of having multiple players was removed due to the complexity of the prototype and the limited time we had to bring it to a point where it was ready for the Edge. The focus of the interactions remained on problem solving and solving logic puzzles.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The story had more paths built into it. There was a beach path which the players could take instead of heading towards the old ruins. If they did they would encounter a bug slap challenge. A bug would jump out and attack. You would need to slap it away. If you failed you would be knocked over and ruin down the beach. Here you would build a fire for a native and be given a place to stay while you wait for rescue (the second ending). If you hit the bug you would walk up the forest path where you found it and encounter a village farmer. Via this path you would be tasked with finding his lost cat. You would break into a village by pushing its door down (via pushing gestures) and rescue the cat from a prison by reconnecting the power (via lifting your hands in the air). Both the village and ruins (previously mentioned) would lead to fixing your ship. The beach leads to waiting for rescue.</p>

					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<p>This was all then tested at the Edge on a variety of people. A record of the number of times people asked for help at different parts of the game was taken along with images and videos. The footage itself, taken by Maximus, was used to generate our final Kickstarter style video.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We still found user feedback was the biggest issue. People often had a hard time understanding certain interactions, or just not knowing how to perform them. Something we did see however that people wanted to replay the game so as to try additional paths. For us this was a win as it meant it was engaging enough to captivate the user into wanting experience it more. This was evident via the beach path. Player who went down this path and encountered the bug slap challenge often failed the first time round, however this meant they wanted to play again, wanting to see what is down that path.</p>

					<!-- Personal Reflection -->
					<h2>In Reflection</h2>
					<br>
					<p>This past semester I started by wanting to create a holographic installation of some sorts. From that my ideas evolved and it has reached the concept of Space Rangers. It's an interactive storytelling video game with branching paths and physical gestures, along with speech recognition for control. Now that it is over I'm a little disappointed in the fact that what we created was just a game however, at the same time I'm proud of it.</p>
					<br>
					<p>From the start I wanted to avoid making a game as it isn't anything new or extreme. It feels like is doesn't push the boundaries of physical computing too much. However, we have created something which required a lot of time and effort, and uses relatively new technologies and concepts for user interactions (in the grand scheme of user interfaces) which makes me happy. It's enabled me to learn a lot more about physical interactions with the Kinect in a game context, something I desired for a long time.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Over the semester my role was primarily as a developer. After working as a team to develop our story, I dove straight into building out story world in Unity. I then moved straight to developing the user interactions and storytelling mechanisms in game. As I solely worked on building the game, the rest of the team worked on other aspects of the course. This including collecting asserts for the game such as audio, creating posters and videos, and refining out story.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I do feel that as a team our initial expectations of the project were greater than what we could achieve. We chose a topic which required an insane amount of content before it was usable. It also didn't really match our skill set as a team. I was the sole 'programmer' and since most of the project time was spent programming this was an oversight. This was likely due to not identifying team skills early on and could likely be fixed with more early stage planning.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I feel as though the project idea definitely addressed the overarching topic of learning in the early years. We have argued that interactive storytelling has the potential to influence early childhood learning? quiet heavily. We saw that our story was able to engage young ones (approx. age of 6 to 8 years) for multiple run throughs as they wished to see what would happen if they did one thing instead of another. The tasks themselves require forethought and problem solving, along with quick thinking. On top of this it has the potential to teach kids that there are consequences for their actions. Traditional storytelling doesn't do this as well. While a message may be able to be conveyed, it is set the player as the antagonist, rather a spectator.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Interactive storytelling immerses the player more deeply into the game. It makes them think more deeply about their choices and what could have happened if they did it another way. This combined with engaging and immersing players for multiple run throughs, which we observed, gives interactive storytelling a strong basis as a means for education.</p>
